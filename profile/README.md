## Hi there 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

The concept was first conceived in September 2024 as a platform that would enhance the fields of education and hiring. After going through three Startup Pre-accelerator programs, Pookie has now changed the direction of two of its ideas. Pookie wants to completely transform the way early-stage job seekers and students interact with small and medium-sized businesses. We tackle this by beginning as an All-in-One Career Analytics platform that links small and medium-sized businesses with job searchers.

Pookie is your best friend, created by students for students and by a small-to medium-sized business for small-to medium-sized businesses. Pookie is there for you during good times and bad. It provides you with the best job recommendations and chances because it knows you better than you do. Even opportunities you never knew you needed.
